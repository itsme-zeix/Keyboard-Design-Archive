# PCB Designs
- The list below is non-exhaustive. Several projects are still in the works and not ready to be shared.
- My designs typically avoid SOD diodes in favour of standard 0805 diodes which are less likely to shear off.
- Size of switch through-hole pads are larger in hopes that they will adhere better and be less likely to lift.
- For commissions or inquiries, please direct message me on Discord @zeix.

## Lain ##
- One off commission designed in collaboration for yz for Squashy Boy. Features a TFT display to show image/gif.

## qwertyqop QQ60 Hotswap PCB ##
- [Purchase here](https://qwertyqop.com/products/qq60)
- Features cutouts matching H60 for increased compatibility.
- TTC sockets to decrease footprint size of sockets, especially at edge cutouts where standard kailh sockets jut out.
- Alternate position for JST port to support Unikorn R2.2.
- Image featured is the prototype (hence the hand-soldered sockets).

## Hera R2 ##

A budget 60% keyboard focused on a flexy and bouncy typing experience.

Uses a half plate with a 1.2mm PCB that has a flex cut between rows 2 and 3. PCB based off the open-sourced plain60.

- Rerun of Hera with small design changes
  - Rounded back
  - Reduced distance between case floor and PCB
  - Switched from aluminium to FR4 plates
  - Added front lip
  - Decreased size of the channel for the JST cable
- Retailed for $320SGD for the base kit which includes:
  - Hera Case (Silver, Black or Lilac) with sandblasted brass weight
  - 1.2mm PCB, daughterboard and JST cable
  - FR4 Half Plate
  - Carrying Case
  - 50A and 70A O Ring
